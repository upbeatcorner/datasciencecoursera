# Scraping exercises

In this class, we'll be scraping two websites. The first is a roster of inmates at the [Boone County Jail](http://www.showmeboone.com/sheriff/JailResidents/JailResidents.asp), and the second is a list of Missouri [state employee salaries](http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Employees/Employee/searchemployees.aspx).

We'll do this using two of Python's most widely used web scraping libraries, [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), which makes it easy to parse and sort through HTML files; and [mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/), which allows you to emulate a web browser from within your Python programs. Detailed documentation for each of those libraries can be found at the links above.
